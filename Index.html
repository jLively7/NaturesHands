                        <p><br>Suet is the fat that surrounds a cows kidneys. Now, I know it sounds weird to put beef fat on your skin, but it has great benefits!</p>

                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?</span>
                        <p><br>One of the biggest advantages of using tallow is that it's biocompatible with our skin. That means its chemical makeup is very similar to the makeup of our skin.</p>

                    <div class="question-card">
                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</span>
                        <p><br>The reason this is important is it allows the tallow to blend into the skin, absorbing quickly to provide moisture and nutrients.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-card">
                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  DOES IT SMELL LIKE FAT?</span>
                        <p><br>Tallow loses the majority - if not all - of its fatty smell before reaching your skin. This is thanks to the rendering process that makes the scent undetectable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-card">
                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  DOES IT FEEL GREASY?</span>
                        <p><br>Due to the rendering process and its molecular makeup, tallow has a very non-greasy, moisturizing, and smooth texture.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-card">
                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  IS IT BETTER FOR MY SKIN?</span>
                        <p><br>Tallow adds moisture to the skin without making you greasy. It works great for dry, combination, and oily skin types. Even those with sensitive skin!</p>

                    <div class="question-card">
                        <span class="question-card__title"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>  WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS?</span>
                        <p><br>Pure tallow has only one ingredient: TALLOW! This keeps the ingredients minimal and preservative free. Making for a simple and safe product to add to your routine.</p>
